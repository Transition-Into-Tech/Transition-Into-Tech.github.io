        <div class="mastercard">I arrived at 8:35 on Monday and was introduced by Mairead who was the supervisor. She gave me a badge with my name and school. I sat down and waited until the other 14 TYs arrived. At 9:00 we were taken upstairs to the room where we spent the whole day. We played an ice breaker and the game two truths and a lie which was fun.
		</BR>
		</BR>

We were first given a talk on mastercard and watched videos. They gave us a buzzword bingo and we had to mark each block when we saw or heard the words and phrases.
		</BR>
		</BR>

A man named Kingsley then talked to us about social media and how people can make money by making videos on YouTube about what interests them.
		</BR>
		</BR>

We were then told about what we will be doing in the afternoon and the next 4 days.

<div class="beacon">My fourth week of work experience was held in Beacon Hospital. My working hours were from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. I was very excited for this experience. The diary describes in detail my day to day work, duties and challenges that I encountered over the three days. It will also outline the skills that I learned and improved on and my reflection on the overall work experience.
</BR>
</BR>

I was so excited for my first day at the Beacon Hospital. I arrived at 7:45. I made my way to the HR Department which was located on suite 13 on the 2nd floor. The hospital was very big and it was so easy to get lost. I waited for the other transition years come. There were 60 applicants in total.
</BR>
</BR>
We were first given a presentation about bacteria, viruses and illnesses. We then learned the steps to wash our hands and Jennifer got all of us to pass an alcohol hand gel and we practiced.
</BR>
</BR>
We were then split into our groups. I was in group 'I' and was given a tour of the hospital by Jennifer which I really enjoyed and found beneficial. I made new friends too which was great.
</BR>
</BR>
We had lunch at 12:00 for an hour. At 1:00 we came back and were given a talk about physiotherapy and speech and language therapy by Elena. I really enjoyed my first day at the Beacon Hospital and am looking forward to the next two days.
Tuesday
</BR>
</BR>
I arrived at 7:45 again today. We were first given a presentation on 'education' by Katie Conlon. She talked to us about manual handling and how imortant it is. She first defined manual handling and said it involves any transporting of load by one or more employees. She also told us about the spinal chord and back handling and that the spine is made up of 33 irregular shaped bones called vertebrae. We were then given a demonstration of how to properly lift and put down a box.
</BR>
</BR>
My group then went to the lab where we were told about transfusions. We were shown the different blood types and platelets. We also looked at red blood cells through a microscope.
</BR>
</BR>
At 12 we went for lunch. After lunch myself and two other people from my group went to the ICV - Intensive Care Unit. Here we were first shown how to properly clean our hands with the gel by a lady. She then timed us while we cleaned our hands. She talked to us about the most important organs in our body which is the brain, the heart and the lungs. She talked to us about how it is possible to get better or overcome different illnesses but anything that happens to any of the most vital organs in the body cannot be recovered. 
</BR>
</BR>
She also showed us the machine bed where patients lie down and how it has to be able to go up, down and all the other machcines have to be checked if they're working properly by someone before the patient enters the room. She told us how important it is to treat the patient how you would like to be treated and to always consult with the patient's family on whether they are happy for them to treat the patient on how they are planning to. She also talked to us about critical care. She said the most important part to working in the ICU is team work.
</BR>
</BR>
We were later shown an x ray and had a look at a man's lungs and his heart which was very interesting. We were finished from there at 2:15 and were allowed to go home.

		<div class ="hilton text-justify">My second week of work experience in November was held in Hilton's Pharmacy, Rathfarnham. 

On Monday I arrived at 10 a.m. I introduced myself to my manager, Carl, the pharmacist, Fiona and the supervisor, Rachel. Carl explained what tasks needed to be done and where I would find everything. I started my work by checking medicines and tablets that were out of date within the year on shelves that were sorted in alphabetical order. I then sorted and stamped prescriptions given by the pharmacist. I had a half an hour break and I was off at 3 p.m.
				</BR>
				</BR>

On Tuesday I started my work by pricing and placing newly delivered medicines, cosmetics and other stock in the correct place. This gave me a chance to learn that all the medicines were placed according to alphabetical order and where the products could be found. I also assisted customers in finding products within the beauty, baby and dental sections.
				</BR>
				</BR>

On Wednesday the day started at 10 a.m and I was on time. I started the day by collecting the medicines as read on the prescriptions and the right amounts that were needed. I then placed the tablets into the weekly pill pack for patients who find it difficult to remember when and how many tablets they have had. I was off at 2:00.
				</BR>
				</BR>

I improved on many skills throughout the week. For some of the days I got the opportunity to deal with customers. This helped me to develop my communication skills as I had to listen to their requests, help them if I could or pass the information onto my supervisor. I became more confident as the days passed by. This was because of dealing with patients, customers and getting along very well with my supervisor and pharmacist. I was also punctual. I got my tasks done on time and did what had to be done without having to be told.

		<div class="whatever">My work experience for the first week in November was held in National College of Ireland. My working hours were from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. The diary describes in detail my day to day work, duties and challenges that I encountered over the week.

				</BR>
		</BR>

		
My first day at NCI was amazing. I went in with an open mind. The day started at 10:00 and I was on time. My friend Benita and I were going to be working in the careers and guidance department for the week.
		</BR>
		</BR>

Caroline explained what tasks needed to be done as soon as I entered the office. I started my work by making advertisements for the students at NCI. The advertisements were on different companies who were offering graduate programmes, internship programmes, work experience or jobs. I used different websites for each company to find out important information. I had to include the aim of the company, their requirements, what type of people they are looking for and the application deadline. I made sure I kept all the advertisements short, clear and to the point.
		</BR>
		</BR>

When I was finished making all the ads, I printed them out. When I was finished my work, I helped Benita and scanned applications on a multi purpose machine that went straight to Benita's email. We went home at 4:00.
